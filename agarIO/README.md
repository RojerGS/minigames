AgarIO
======

This game is a cheap spin-off of the game that can be played at [agar.io](https://agar.io).

In this local version, two players have to eat "food" that pops up around them and then eat the other player.

The left player moves with `ASDW` and the right player moves with `JKLI`. Press `ESC` to exit the game.
