# HueHue

## A game of colour

HueHue is a very simple game where you start with several tiles with different colours and the goal is to organize them in such a way that the colours create a soothing and harmonious degradee. Note that when the game starts the four corners are already the correct tiles.

The tiles are swapped by left-clicking one of the tiles you want to swap and then right-clicking the other one.

The idea of this game is not ours but the implementation is a joint work by me and [@inesfmarques](https://github.com/inesfmarques).
