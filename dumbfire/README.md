## A simple shooting game

In this one-player shooting game you are a white ball trying to escape the chase of green, red and blue balls. To avoid being hit by them, just shoot them by pressing the spacebar and by pointing at them with your mouse.

On the bottom right you have your health that is depleted each time you are hit by a coloured ball and replenished each time you kill a coloured ball. Use the `WASD` keys to move and the spacebar to shoot.

As of now, the game has no menu whatsoever. As soon as the scripts starts running, the game starts. When you lose, the window closes.
